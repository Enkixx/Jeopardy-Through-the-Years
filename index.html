    <h1>Jeopardy Through The Years</h1>
    <div id="intro">
      Welcome to Jeopardy Through The Years! This game pulls from all the categories and clues from Jeopardy history. A few things to note. All questions are worth one point with their original value listed to show the originally intended difficulty of the question. This is done due to a few quirks related to the nature of the older questions. Some questions are significantly harder due to how old they are, especially in the case of the various pop culture categories that have appeared through the years. I also belive that due to the wide range of years, some answers may even be wrong according to today's knowledge. If the categories are not your favorites or you aren't sure of the correct answer, don't hesitate to refresh the categories. Player Score will reset on an incorrect answer. If you want to close the question without answering and losing points, hit the ? button with the input field empty. Good Luck!
